title: three years at GDS
---
I've now been at GDS for just over three years. This is now my second longest job and I can see it  lasting a lot longer. Most
jobs after two years it's time to move on. 6 months learning and fire fighting, 6 months fixing things, 6 months making things
better and then 6 months being bored because there isn't a new project to move onto.

I joined GDS a few months after GOV.UK had launched but there was still things to-do on the GOV. UK Infrastructure.
* implement  centralised logging
* move to a new cdn provider
* move hosting twice
* opened our puppet repo

It matters in the past I've worked in banner ads, tracking, building the first PAAS, e-commerce, mobile gaming, crm, photo
hosting. None of these things fill me with personal pride working on GOV.UK does. At my previous places I would dismiss
disaster recovery discussions which got as far as nuclear war because they don't matter and I wouldn't care since I would be
aswell. The discussion is worth having for gov.UK.
The other thing which has kept me here is my changing roles in my time here. I became a senior and then became the product
owner for the GOV.UK infra team. I'm also currently the interim head of the webops community at gds. Making sure people are
happy and in the right place. As well as leading recruitment. These are interesting new things to do and help my transition to
someone becoming post technical. Being at the coal face writing puppet doesn't appeal as much anymore. Although I do still
enjoy playing with tech.
