title: longest job ever!
---

I've now been at GDS for over three and a half years. This is now my longest
job ever and I can see it lasting a lot longer. Most jobs after two years it's
time to move on. 6 months learning and fire fighting, 6 months fixing things, 6
months making things better and then 6 months being bored because there isn't a
new project to move onto. Lets put it this way I was relieved that was made redundant from my previous longest job.

I'm still at GDS and indeed still working on GOV.UK because it matters.

I've always taken professional pride at my previous places of employment that we kept the sites
up but not personal pride. GOV.UK gives me that. Even supposedly running the first [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service#Development_and_uses) didn't fill me with personal pride.
Serving banner ads after the apocalypse is less important than serving your nation's website.

I joined GDS a few months after GOV.UK had launched but there was still things
to-do on the GOV. UK Infrastructure.
* implement  centralised logging
* move to a new cdn provider
* move hosting twice
* opened our puppet repo

It matters in the past I've worked in banner ads, tracking, building the first
PAAS, e-commerce, mobile gaming, crm, photo hosting. None of these things fill
me with personal pride working on GOV.UK does. At my previous places I would
dismiss disaster recovery discussions which got as far as nuclear war because
they don't matter and I wouldn't care since I would be aswell. The discussion
is worth having for gov.UK.  The other thing which has kept me here is my
changing roles in my time here. I became a senior and then became the product
owner for the GOV.UK infra team. I'm also currently the interim head of the
webops community at gds. Making sure people are happy and in the right place.
As well as leading recruitment. These are interesting new things to do and help
my transition to someone becoming post technical. Being at the coal face
writing puppet doesn't appeal as much anymore. Although I do still enjoy
playing with tech.
